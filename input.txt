Hello World. Today is the first day that I will be creating a program from scratch.
This program is merely going to translate an input text file into piglatin. Piglatin
is an informal language in which the words are english words with the first letter of
the word placed at the end and an 'a' placed after this operation. So, 'hello' in piglatin
would be 'elloha'. Enjoy!
